# integrate
  Enter the function of variable x, that you would like to integrate eg "x*sin(x)**4" , enter the lower and upper limits of the integral, eg 0 1 .
 Since we are computing this integral numerically we need to tell the program on how many intervals to divide the original interval, eg 100 . If we do not provide this last number then program by default divides the interval on 10 pieces. The integration is done using the trapezoidal rule.
